# Semster_Project_part-2_Abdullah_Khubaib_Faizan
This is a submission of Deep Learning project part2 , Here is a three models of Segmentations to predict Depth from RGB-D ,  


This a submission of Deep_Learning semester project part 2.
group members are:
1- Abdullah Abid 362376.
2-Khubaib Hidar Khan 363126
3-Muhammad Faizan Faiz 362940

All the notebooks includded here was Ran in Kaggle :

1- Abdullah model :  https://www.kaggle.com/code/rafeytahir23/depth-segmentation (Look for Abdullah Abid version)
2-Khubaib model : https://www.kaggle.com/code/rafeytahir23/depth-segmentation (Look for Khubaib Hidar version)
3- Fizan Model : https://www.kaggle.com/code/abdullah7987/depth-segmentation(Look for Fizan Faiz version)

4- The ensembling and utilization :  https://www.kaggle.com/code/abdullah362376/ensembling (Look for version_2)



basically :
1- we built 3 segmentation models with 3 different architectures, the goal of each model is to input an RGB image and output "predict" a Depth mask  

2- after the 3 model were built, applied model ensembling to average out a single universal model.



I recommend that instead of checking the notebooks here on git hub , you should go and chick in Kaggle, for better understanding
